<h2 id="round-1-writing-and-drama">Round 1: Writing and drama</h2>
<p>As an upstart 17 year old I did the infamous Creative Writing course at Victoria University with Bill Manhire. I got an A for my poetry portfolio which meant quite a lot a the time, being so young. But then I lost confidence and never really tried to get any poetry published.</p>
<p>I also had the drama bug and, while I was attending University in Wellington and Dunedin, managed to fit a little bit of coursework around a frenetic schedule of theatre making. This was a not a great way to get good marks or finish a degree. The one year I decided to limit my acting I got straight As across my arts courses but my heart wasn&#39;t in it and I never finished my degree.</p>
<h2 id="round-2-drama-school-and-being-an-actor">Round 2: Drama School and being an actor</h2>
<p>Drama school was the right place for me at the right time, I loved my time at The New Zealand Drama School (1990-91). After graduation I had a solid young-actor career and did a range of theatre, devised theatre, radio, TV, playback theatre and short films; plus script development workshops and a bit of script reading. I was good enough that I didn&#39;t need a second job.</p>
<p>Highlights include: Dolls House, Circa Theatre; 12th Night, Circa and Depot; Comedy of errors, Circa;  Unidentified Human Remains, Circa; Fallout, TVNZ.</p>
<h2 id="round-3-playwriting">Round 3: Playwriting</h2>
<p>Being an actor was good but I become a lot more interested in scripts - sourcing the vision rather than interpreting it. I started my first full length play in 1992 and I have never really stopped.</p>

<h2 id="round-4-electronic-writing-and-grad-dip">Round 4: Electronic Writing and Grad Dip</h2>
<p>I moved to Australia and did a Grad Dip in Swinburne in Writing and learned about a new form of writing called &#39;hyper text&#39; or &#39;electronic&#39; writing. I was fascinated and produced a number of ambitious creative and theoretical works in the late 90s, while still writing plays. About this time I also got involved in the making of websites - my day job ever since.</p>

<h2 id="round-5-film-scripts-fiction">Round 5: Film scripts / Fiction</h2>
<p>At the turn of the Millennium I moved to London. While still writing plays I also branched out into learning about screen writing resulting in a number of film scripts. I also spent a number of years trying to write fiction at this point, but can&#39;t say I ever really found it as fulfilling as drama - and it takes a lot more time, so my rate of production while having a full time job and a family, dropped.</p>

<h2 id="round-6-cycology-and-back-to-poetry-">Round 6: Cycology and back to poetry.</h2>
<p>While I was writing fiction I also started writing pieces about cycling and then my &#39;blog to book&#39; Balance. The attraction of this at the time was simply to see something on a page in public - I could write a good blog in a couple of sittings.</p>
<p><a href="cycology.html">Some writing about riding</a></p>
<p>I never really stopped writing poetry over many many years but about this time (2015) I started to take it a little more seriously again and have enjoyed getting into the contemporary poetry scene in the UK.</p>
<p><a href="poems.html">More about that here</a></p>
<p>And I am still writing plays - the place where I feel most at home. However I would write an extended piece of non-fiction/creative non-fiction like Balance in a heart beat; currently I am seriously considering what my next piece will be. The lesson here was that my &#39;hobby&#39; writing was better than what I thought was the &#39;real&#39; writing at the time. And while I was doing all that I continue to write plays - one every few years now.</p>
