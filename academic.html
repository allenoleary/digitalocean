<p>Due to a ongoing love affair with acting and making theatre I never quite got around to finishing my degree. I got some great individual course results - note that you couldn&#39;t do a degree in theatre or acting in NZ at this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative writing: A</li>
<li>History of Architecture: A</li>
<li>Hsitory of Comtemporary Music: A</li>
<li>English 1 + 2: A</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="round-2-nz-drama-school">Round 2: NZ drama School</h2>
<p>I attended the NZ Drama School (Toi Whakari) in 1990/91. At the time the course was funded and run by the Arts Council - it was the only practical acting course in the country at this time. As such it was, despite being the defacto way to acting and theatre success at the time - not an official educational course of any kind. </p>
<p>Later the course was expanded to three years and made a Degree in performance.</p>

<p>A graduate diploma at this time in Australia was the equivilent of an MA in England now -  one year full time or two part time. I did this one over two years. It was an ungraded course.</p>
<p>I won the Swinburne Postgraduate Course Work award (across all schools) with my Hypertext piece, The Casino Project.</p>
<h2 id="round-4-associate-lecturer">Round 4: Associate Lecturer</h2>
<p>For around three years I made my living being an Associate Lecturer at the University of Victoria in Melbourne. I taught and supervised projects at post grad level in their Electronic Design and Interactive Media dept. I wrote and delivered some of the first ever courses in web design and animation as well as starting some new courses from scrath including a &#39;Writing for Interactive Design&#39; course.</p>
<p>I also taught a couple of undergrad units in Electronic Writing back at Swinburne.</p>
