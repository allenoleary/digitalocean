<p>“Others in this amazing and largely entertaining dramatic collage are part of a crazy farce involving golf clubs and sexual liberation, land-grabbing and domination as well as ideas of liberty, equality and fraternity. And blood. When run in The Vampyre Dances should step lightly across all boundaries of political correctness so that the mix of dramatic genres will be able to work effectively as the parable that it’s creators intended.” -Dominion</p>
